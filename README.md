# my CAS projects
This repository contains modul works for two modules done in a CAS programm - Certificate of Advanced Studies in Applied Data Science (ADS) - at the University of Bern.

## content
Both modul works (Modul2, Modul3) found in the repository deal about electricity price forecasting for day-ahead market in switzerland. So it's about time series forecasting.
In both modules we make use of data from the transparency plattform of entsoe found on https://transparency.entsoe.eu. Data is already prepared and provided within the repository of the two moduls.

In the Modul2 work loads a given set of data and compares different models to train and fit the electricity prices for switzerland by means of sklearn library. This modul work was done in Oktober 2020.

In Modul3 exended data (i.e. enriched with time infromation) is given and will train and fit electricity prices for switzerland using neuronal networks models given from a tensorflow tutorial (see: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series). This modul work was done in March 2021.

These both are different approaches and for an optimal approach could be combined in future to get better forcasting results (work in progress).


## Usage & Installation
Both modul works are provided in form of notebooks.
For further description refer to the readme.pdf in the repository directories of the modul:
