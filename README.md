# my CAS projects
This repository contains modul works for two modules done in a CAS programm - Certificate of Advanced Studies in Applied Data Science (ADS) - at the University of Bern.

## content
Both modul works deal about electricity price forecasting for switzerland. So it's about time series forecasting.
In both modules we make use of data from the transparency plattform of entsoe found on https://transparency.entsoe.eu, data is in already prepared and provided within the modul work.

In the Modul2 work loads a given set of data and compares different models to train and fit the electricity prices for switzerland by means of sklearn library.

In Modul3 exended data (i.e. enriched with time infromation) is given and will train and fit electricity prices for switzerland using neuronal networks models given from a tensorflow tutorial (see: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series).

These both are different approaches and for an optimal approach could be combined in future to get better forcasting results (work in progress).
